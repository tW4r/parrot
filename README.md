# Parrot - Robin Grow Fork, modified for comma separated multi-channel listening, colors, channel selection, Twitch Emotes, and more!

**THIS FORK WAS MADE WITHIN soKukuneli**

This is not the main branch! But it has some great additional features!

Special thanks to OrangeredStilton, Voltaek, Dashed, lost_penguin, Daegalus, Wakafanykai123, Stormagnet, AviN456 and all our testers.
